"Methods: Mice were infected by intranasal inoculation with influenza A viruses (strains: H 1 N 1 and H 3 N 2 ) or PBS. Animals were exposed to aerosols of ovalbumin on day 3. Two weeks after ovalbumin sensitization, mice were challenged with oval- bumin aerosols; 24 hours later, airway responsiveness (AR) to inhaled methacholine, levels of ovalbumin-specific IgE, and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) were examined. Results: Neither influenza A virus (H 1 N 1 nor H 3 N 2 ) alone nor ovalbumin sensitization alone caused changes in AR or IgE. However, ovalbumin sensitization after inoculation with either influenza A virus increased AR and levels of ovalbumin-specif- ic IgE. On BALF-cell analysis, ovalbumin sensitization after inoculation with influenza virus A increased the number of lymphocytes but not the number of eosinophils. No difference in AR or IgE levels was observed between the 2 strains of influenza A viruses. Immmunostaining of BALF cells showed an increase in T cells, especially CD8 + cells, with ovalbumin sensitization after inoculation with influenza virus A. Conclusion: Infection by influenza A virus enhances sensitiza- tion to inhaled antigens and airway responsiveness in mice by means of mechanisms including CD8 + cells and antigen-specif- ic IgE Abbreviations used BAL: Bronchoalveolar lavage BALF: Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid FRC: Functional residual capacity H 1 N 1 : Influenza virus A/PR/8/34 H 3 N 2 : Influenza virus A/Guizhou-X PD 35 Mch: Cumulative dose of inhaled methacholine at which airway resistance increases by 35% PFU: Plaque-forming unit sRaw: Specific airway resistance sRaw L : sRaw of the lower airway",1

"Combination of multiplex reverse-transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification with an immunochromatographic strip for subtyping influenza A virus Multiplex RT-LAMP for HA and M genes was developed for subtyping influenza A virus. Multiplex RT-LAMP amplicons were simply analyzed by the colorimetric ICS detection. Multiplex RT-LAMP (40 min) and ICS detection (15 min) could be complete in 55 min. Detection sensitivity for the multi- plex RT-LAMP and ICS was 10 copies of viral RNA. Our methodology provides simple, rapid genetic analysis platform for viral detection",1

"impaired production of immune mediators in dengue virus type 2-infected mononuclear cells of adults with end stage renal disease-infected mononuclear cells at 6 h, 24 h, 48 h, and 72 h post-infection. We found in the ESRD group significantly higher GM-CSF and IL-2 levels at 6 h post-infection. However, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12p40, TNF-α, MCP-1, and MIP-1b levels were found significantly lower than in the control group. At 24 h, 48 h, and 72 h post-infection, significantly lower levels of IL-1Ra, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12p40, TNF-α, MCP-1, and MIP-1b were detected in ESRD group. Concentration of VEGF at 24 h and 48 h, and of GM-CSF at 48 h and 72 h were also found to be lower in ESRD group than in control group. Compared with controls, the viral load Ct values were significantly lower in ESRD group at 6 h and 24 h post-infection No significant difference in viral load Ct values between two groups was found at 48 h and 72 h post-infection. Our study discloses that the expression of immune mediators of dengue-infected mononuclear cells is impaired in ESRD patients",1

M-mediated IFN-␤ induction was confirmed at the viral infection level since a point mutation at the V68 residue of M markedly inhibited SARS-CoV pseudovirally induced IFN-␤ production. Thus, the results in- dicate for the first time that SARS-CoV M protein may function as a cytosolic PAMP to stimulate IFN-␤ production by activating a TLR-related TRAF3-independent signaling cascade",1
