Abstract 27 The positive stranded RNA genomes of picornaviruses comprise a single large open reading 28 frame flanked by 5\\u2032 and 3\\u2032 untranslated regions (UTRs). Foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) 29 has an unusually large 5\\u2032 UTR (1.3 kb) containing five structural domains. These include the 30 internal ribosome entry site (IRES), which facilitates initiation of translation, and the cis-acting 31 replication element (cre). Less well characterised structures are a 5\\u2032 terminal 360 nucleotide 32 stem-loop, a variable length poly-C-tract of approximately 100-200 nucleotides and a series of 33 two to four tandemly repeated pseudoknots (PKs). We investigated the structures of the PKs 34 by selective 2\\u2032 hydroxyl acetylation analysed by primer extension (SHAPE) analysis and 35 determined their contribution to genome replication by mutation and deletion experiments. 36 SHAPE and mutation experiments confirmed the importance of the previously predicted PK 37 structures for their function. Deletion experiments showed that although PKs are not essential 38\",\n",

This observation is consistent with a previous report of deletion of PK1, 473 along with the Poly-C-tract, with no adverse effect in viral replication (37). This also supports 474 our findings that the truncation of the Poly-C-tract to create the C11 construct had no effect on 475 replicon replication in the cell lines tested. As has been described with Mengo virus, it is 476 possible that the role of the poly-C-tract is essential in other aspects of the viral lifecycle which 477 cannot be recapitulated in a standard tissue culture system (39).\",\n",

Here we showed by sequential passage that 481 replicons containing at least two PKs were maintained at a level similar to wt, but replicons 482 containing only one PK showed a persistent decline. It is unclear why some viral isolates 483 contain two, three or four PKs is still unknown, but this may be stochastic variation or may 484 reflect subtle effects of host range or geographical localisation.

It occurs as seven, antigenically diverse 46 serotypes; A, O, C, Asia 1, South African Territories (SAT) 1, 2 and 3. It is the causative agent 47 of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD), a highly contagious disease of cloven-hooved animals 48 affecting most notably cattle, pigs, sheep and goats in addition to wild species such as the 49 African buffalo. Disease outbreaks have serious economic implications resulting from trade 50 restrictions, reduced productivity and the slaughter of infected and at-risk animals (1). The 51 2001 outbreak in the UK caused economic losses of over \\u00a38 billion to the tourism and 52 agricultural sectors. Inactivated virus vaccines are used in countries in which FMD is endemic, 53 but these are often strain-specific and provide little cross protection between serotypes (2). 54 Antigenic variation together with the relatively short duration of immunity following 55 vaccination combine to complicate control of the disease (3). In addition, the carrier state, in 56 which asymptomatically infected animals continue to shed virus, contributes to the spread of 57 FMDV (4). An improved understanding of the viral life cycle may be important for the 58 development of improved vaccines and other control measures. 59 60 The FMDV genome (approximately 8.4 kb) consists of a single open reading frame flanked by 61 5\\u2032 and 3\\u2032 untranslated regions (UTRs) (figure 1A) (5). The translated region encodes both 62 structural and non-structural proteins. The P1 region encodes the capsid structural proteins VP1, 63\",\n",

Of these five structural domains, functions have 76 been ascribed to only two, the cre and IRES. The cre region is involved in uridylation of the 77 RNA primer peptide, VPg (also known as 3B), and the IRES determines the initiation of 78 translation of the viral polyprotein (13, 14). The roles of the S-fragment, the poly-C tract and 79 the PKs in viral replication are not fully elucidated, however recent studies have shown that 80 truncations to the S-fragment can play key roles in the innate immune response to viral 81 infection (15-17). It has also recently been reported that viruses containing a deletion within 82 the pseudoknot region showed an attenuated phenotype in bovine cell lines while remaining 83 unchanged in porcine, suggesting a role for the pseudoknots in viral tropism (18).\",\n",

As both isomers of the photocleavable 3-amino-3-(2nitro) phenyl-propanoic acid (Anp) used during solid phase peptide synthesis of the conditional ligand, 2 diasteroisomers could usually be identified. In some cases, however, the two isomers failed to separate during chromatography. The data displayed is for one of the two isomers, mostly for doubly charged molecules (M 2+ ), together with the amino acid sequences of conditional ligands where the letter J represents Anp.\\nA. Cells were first analyzed for their size and granularity based on their forward scatter area (FSC-A) and side scatter area (SSC-A) profile. Doublets were excluded using side-scatter height (SSC-H) vs side-scatter width (SSC-W) and forward-scatter height (FSC-H) vs forwardscatter width (FSC-W) parameters. Cells present in all three gates were analyzed for their time vs forward scatter area (FSC-A) to exclude cells that were read at the beginning and end of the flow cytometry run. Viable cells were gated based on their negative staining with the Live/Dead® dye (Invitrogen), and these cells were finally analyzed for anti-human CD8 antibodies and HLA-tetramer stainings. All data were analyzed using FlowJo (Tree Star C. Culturing of PBMCs to develop antigen-specific T cell lines. PBMCs isolated from healthy volunteers' blood were stimulated by antigens from EBV-LMP2419-427 (TYGPVFMSL) or HCMV-IE-142-50 (KEVNSQLSL) and cultured in 25 U/mL IL-2, 5% AB serum in RPMI for 14 days. HLA tetramer staining for antigen-specific T cells was performed on day 0, 7, 10 and 14 days post stimulation. The conditional ligands are based on peptides found to be associated to the various HLA molecules.

       "'In December 2019, a cluster of patients with pneumonia of unknown cause were reported in the city of Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, and epidemiologically linked to a seafood wholesale market [1, 2] . It has been determined that the pathogen causing the viral pneumonia among affected individuals is a new coronavirus (2019-nCoV) [1, 3] . The pathogen exhibits high human-to-human transmissibility and has spread rapidly within and beyond Wuhan city [4, 5] . On January 30 th , 2020, World Health Organization (WHO) declared the 2019-nCoV outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern [6] .\\nWuhan is central China\\'s transportation hub with a population of 11 million residents and a large number of higher-education students (~1.3 million in 89 universities and colleges), a particularly mobile population [7] . Beyond these factors, viral spread was likely exacerbated further by the surge in domestic and international travel during the 40-day Lunar New Year (LNY) celebrations (from January 10 th , 2020 to February 18 th , 2020) -the largest annual human migration in the world, comprised of hundreds of millions of people travelling across the country. As of February 4 th , 2020, China has reported 20,530 confirmed cases and 23,314 suspected cases with 2019-nCoV infections [8] . Of the confirmed cases, 2788 are severe and 426 people have died. Most cases were reported from Wuhan and other cities in Hubei Province, and all provinces have confirmed cases imported from Wuhan and secondary transmission has been reported in some provinces. Additionally, there were 153 cases reported in 23 countries outside of China, with most having a travel history involving Wuhan [6] .\\nThe potential pathway from this local outbreak in Wuhan to a pandemic might involve four steps: i) local transmission in Wuhan (primary city of epidemic); ii) spread from Wuhan to other cities within and beyond China via infected travellers, causing sporadic secondary transmission in these cities (secondary city of epidemic), iii) further spreading from secondary cities with local transmission to other tertiary cities in China and international cities via returning travellers after the LNY holiday; iv) onward transmission across multiple countries and leading to a pandemic. To interrupt the spread, a cordon sanitaire of Wuhan and surrounding cities in Hubei Province has been in place since January 23 rd , 2020, just two days before the LNY\\'s Day. However, significant numbers of people had likely already travelled back to their hometowns for the holiday by this time. According to Wuhan authorities, it is .

Given the current epidemic and limited understanding of the epidemiology of this disease, our findings on travel patterns from historical data can help contribute to tailoring public health interventions.\\nTo identify the areas that are most vulnerable to virus importation, we performed and integrated a series of analyses, by using de-identified and aggregated mobile phone-based population movement data, air passenger itinerary data, and case reports. We defined the potential risk and geographic range of 2019-nCoV virus spread across three scenarios: 1) from the primary city (Wuhan) into other cities in mainland China (31 provincial regions), 2) from high-risk secondary cities into other cities across China, and 3) from high-risk cities in mainland China into cities in other countries or regions during the LNY holiday and the following three months. We also estimated the number of airline travellers likely needing to be quarantined or screened to capture travellers potentially exposed to 2019-nCoV in high-risk cities of mainland China.\\nTo define daily patterns and the connectivity of population movements at county and prefecture (city) level across mainland China during the LNY holiday and the following three months, we used the aggregated and de-identified daily flow of the users of Baidu, the largest Chinese search engine [10] . Baidu offers location-based service (LBS), based on the global positioning system (GPS), IP address, location of signalling towers and WIFI, for online searching, mapping, and a large variety of apps and software for mobile devices. These data have been used to visualize population migration around Chinese New Year [10] . Two Baidu datasets were used in this study. The first one covers daily movement data at county level from December 1 st , 2013 to April 30 th , 2014, as described elsewhere [11] . We calculated relative .

The last recorded locations of a user (or device) for each day were compared, and if the location changed, then we counted the user (or device) as someone who had moved from one city to another city. To understand the spread risk of 2019-nCoV from Wuhan into other cities via domestic population movement, we aggregated daily outflows of people from Wuhan to other cities across mainland China for the two weeks (the quarantine period of the virus) prior to the cordon sanitaire of Wuhan. As the travel ban took place on January 23 rd , 2020, just 2 days before LNY\\'s day, and given that LNY\\'s day in 2015 was February 19 th , we took February 17 th , 2015 as a reference of the lockdown day in our dataset. Using the second dataset, then the risk of importation for each destination city or province was preliminarily defined as the percentage of travellers received by each city or province out of the total volume of travellers leaving Wuhan during the two weeks before the city\\'s lockdown.\\nThese secondary cities may have a high risk of community-level transmission through the introduction of infected travellers from Wuhan, and then spread the virus to other tertiary cities by returning population movements after the LNY holiday, causing an even wider spread of the virus. As most of the cities in Hubei province have implemented the same travel controls as Wuhan before LNY, we defined the high-risk secondary cities outside of Hubei province as the cities within top 30 ranked cities (Supplementary Table S1 ) with the highest risk of importation from Wuhan defined above. Based on the 2015 Baidu dataset on population movement, the risk of spreading the virus from high-risk secondary cities to tertiary cities was preliminarily calculated as the averaged percentage of travellers received by each tertiary city out of the total volume of travellers leaving each high-risk secondary city during the four weeks following LNY\\'s Day. We chose a period of four weeks because the returning flow of LNY\\'s population movement, Chunyun, generally lasts four weeks.\\n.

IATA data accounts for approximately 90% of passenger travel itineraries on commercial flights, and these data represent direct origin (Wuhan) to destination trips, and indirect trips that originated in Wuhan, but had connecting flights to a final destination. We quantified monthly volumes of airline travellers departing Wuhan and high-risk secondary cities from February 1 st , 2018, through April 30 th , 2018. With the assumption that the population movements around the LNY holiday in 2020 was consistent with the pattern in 2018, all final destinations were ranked by volumes of airline travellers, and the relative risk of importation was defined as the percentage of airline travellers received by each destination city out of the total volume of travellers leaving high-risk cities in China.\\nWe also estimated the number of airline travellers that may have needed to be kept in quarantine from Wuhan during the two weeks prior to the city\\'s travel ban. The LNY\\'s day in 2018 was on February 16 and the lockdown of Wuhan happened two days before LNY\\'s day, corresponding to the date of February 14 th , 2018. We therefore defined the number of travellers needing to be quarantined as half of the volume of airline travellers from Wuhan in February, 2018, representing the 2-week total number of travellers for the first half of February. We then estimated the number of infections and its 95% uncertainty interval (UI) in these airline travellers from Wuhan, based on a binomial distribution and the proportion of 2019-nCoV infections in the citizens evacuated from Wuhan reported by Singapore, South Korea, Japan, and Germany, as of January 31 st , 2020 [6, [14] [15] [16] [17] .\\nAdditionally, to capture travellers potentially exposed to virus, we also estimated the volume of airline travellers that would be required to be screened at origin high-risk cities in China and destinations across the globe for the following three months of February to April. Considering air traffic flows from China have changed due to the airline flight cancellations, travel restrictions imposed by countries or regions, or changes in travel behaviours, we calculated the volume of travellers using different scenarios of reductions (50%, 75%, and 90%) in total passenger volumes.\\n.

Additionally, we also compared the spatial patterns of the risks of Chinese cities importing the virus from Wuhan, estimated by the population movement data in 2014 and 2015, and more recent data on the top 50 ranked origin and destination cities in January 2020, available from the Baidu Migration site (https://qianxi.baidu.com/). To futher validate our results, we also compared the importation risk estimated in this study with the number of reported imported cases from Wuhan to other provinces in mainland China, as of January 25 th , 2020, and the number of imported cases reported by other countries or regions, as of February 3 rd , 2020 [6] . The distribution between days of travelling from Wuhan, illness onset, first medical visit, and hospitalization of imported cases, as of January 25 th , 2020, were also analysed. These case data were collated from the websites of WHO, national and local health authorities or new agencies within and beyond China (Supplementary Note). R version 3.6.1 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria) was used to perform data analyses.\\nSignificant migratory flows occurred in opposite directions before and after LNY\\'s Day. In Wuhan City, mass movements of people began about three weeks prior to LNY, with the first peak of population leaving the city before the start of the winter holiday for universities, especially in the three counties that contain many universities and students (Figure 1 ). Although a cordon sanitaire of Wuhan and some cities in Hubei Province has been in place since January 23 rd , 2020, the timing of this may have occurred during the latter stages of peak population numbers leaving Wuhan, as another peak of movements out of the city was seen 2 days before LNY\\'s day.\\nWe found that a large number of travellers were likely departing Wuhan into neighbouring cities and other megacities in China before Wuhan\\'s .

Other cities in Hubei Province received huge amounts of people during the two weeks before LNY and showed a decreasing population since LNY, following a peak of outflow at the end of the LNY holiday (Figure 1b and Supplementary Table S2 ). If Wuhan\\'s lockdown had not have been undertaken, our analyses suggest the main destination cities of population outflow since LNY would have been similar to the situation two weeks prior to LNY (Supplementary Table S3 ).\\nIn terms of the initial importation risk of virus for each city during the two weeks before Wuhan\\'s lockdown, nearly all other cities in Hubei Province were estimated to be high-risk areas (Figure 2a ). Other places with high risks were Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou and other large cities. In terms of the provincial level, the risks were high in Guangdong and Hunan, followed by Henan and Zhejiang (Figure 2b ). There was a significant correlation (r-squared = 0.59, p < 0.001) between the number of imported cases and the risk of importation estimated from traveller numbers from Wuhan within the two weeks before LNY\\'s Day (Figure 3a ). Further, a high proportion of cases travelled with symptoms at the early stage of the outbreak, and the lag from illness onset to hospitalization decreased from a median of 6 days (Interquartile range: 4-7 days) in the first half of January 2020 to 3 days (1-5 days) in the second half ( Figure 4 ).\\nAccording to our definition outlined in the methods, the 17 high-risk secondary cities outside of Hubei Province were identified as: Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Zhengzhou, Tianjin, Hangzhou, Jiaxing, Changsha, Xi\\'an, Nanjing, Shenzhen, Chongqing, Nanchang, Chengdu, Hefei, Fuzhou, and Dongguan ( Figure 5) . Should community-level outbreaks occur in these cities, they could contribute to further spread of infection to other highly connected cities within China via movement after the holiday (Supplementary Figures S1 and S2 ).\\nBased on historical air travel data, the connectivity and spread risk between high-risk cities in mainland China and cities in other countries or regions was defined for the three months around the LNY holiday (Supplementary Figure S3 and Tables S4 and S5). Bangkok, Hong Kong, and Taipei ranked in the top three, followed by Seoul, Tokyo and Singapore. The main destinations were presented by region in the supplemental materials (Supplementary Figures S3-S9 and Table S4 -S7). During the two weeks before Wuhan\\'s lockdown, there were an estimated total 59,912 airline .

Thailand, Japan, and Taiwan ranked in the top three, followed by Malaysia, Hong Kong, and Singapore. Based on an overall infection rate of 1.39% (16/1149; 95% UI: 0.80% -2.25%) in citizens evacuated from Wuhan before Table S8 ). As of February 3 rd , 2020, a significant correlation (r-squared = 0.58, p < 0.001) was seen between the number of imported cases reported in those countries or regions and the risk of importation via travellers defined in our study (Figure 3b ).\\nBecause significant intranational and international spread from Wuhan has already occurred, a very large number of airline travellers (6.5 million under the scenario of 50% travel reduction as usual, 3.3 million under 75% reduction, and 1.3 million under 90% reduction, respectively) would be required to be screened at origin high-risk cities in China ( Figure 5 ) and destinations across the globe for the following three months of February to April, 2020 (Table 1 and  Supplementary Tables S9 and S10) , to ensure that all travellers from high risk cities were covered.\\nAddtionally, based on monthly air passenger travel statistics and time series of public and school holidays in 91 countries from 2010 to 2018 (Supplementary Note), we found the seasonal pattens of domestic and international population movements across years were highly consistent with the timing and duration of public and school holidays in different countries (Supplementary Figure S10 and S11) . Moreover, we also found similar spatial patterns in the risks of Chinese cities importing the virus from Wuhan via population movements estimated by both the Baidu data in 2014 and 2015, and the more recent data covering the top 50 ranked destinations in 2020, (Figure 1a and Supplementary Figure S12) , highlighting the value of using historical data to rapidly assess present day risks.\\nMobile phone-based population movement data and air passenger . CC-BY-NC 4.0 International license It is made available under a author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.\\nis the (which was not peer-reviewed) The copyright holder for this preprint . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.04.20020479 doi: medRxiv preprint itinerary data have been widely used to quantify the connectivity and transmission risk of pathogens via domestic and international human travel [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] . Given the rapidly growing number of confirmed 2019-nCoV infections, increasing evidence of human-to-human transmission within and beyond China [4, 24] , and our limited understanding of this novel virus [25, 26] , the findings here from travel patterns in historical data and spread risk estimation can help guide public health preparedness and intervention design across the world [27] .\\nIn terms of domestic connectivity and risk, the high population outflows from three counties in Wuhan with many colleges and universities in the first two weeks of January were likely college students leaving the city to avoid the peak traffic just one week before the New Year. Because of the early timing of this movement, many students might have avoided the period when the virus spread rapidly in Wuhan, and their risk of spreading the virus may be low as well. However, our results suggest that during the two weeks prior to Wuhan\\'s travel ban, a large number of travellers still departed Wuhan into neighbouring cities and other megacities in China and may have spread the virus to new areas, as the timing of the lockdown occurred during the latter stages of peak population numbers leaving Wuhan. Further exacerbating this risk, we found that during the outbreak\\'s initial stages, a particularly high proportion of cases travelled with illness caused by the virus, together with the transmissibility of 2019-nCoV through asymptomatic contacts, potentially causing additional transmission during travel [28] .\\nMoreover, several destination cities ( Figure 5 ) outside of Hubei Province that received high volume of travellers from Wuhan prior to LNY\\'s day may serve as significant secondary cities in the outbreak. Most of these cities have large populations and international airports, highly connected with other regions within and beyond China. The initial imported seed cases likely caused the local community transmission, and further spread the virus into wider geographical ranges following the population flows occurring due to the LNY holiday [19] . Therefore, substantial public health interventions have been immediately applied across the country since LNY, including the cordon sanitaire in several of the most affected cities, cancellation of mass gatherings, reduction of travel and contact rate, as well as the extension of the LNY and school winter holiday, which might mitigate subsequent local establishment of 2019-nCoV introduced by travellers.\\nBeyond the cases that have occurred in China, air passengers have spread 2019-nCoV across countries and continents within a short time period [28, 29] . In particular, a high volume of international airline travellers left .

Substantial preparedness efforts at destination cities should be taken to prevent further international seeding and transmission, otherwise the local establishment of epidemics, and even a pandemic, might become inevitable. For example, exit and entry screening may be futher extended to capture travellers with fever who have potentially been exposed to the virus in high-risk Chinese cities where local transmission has been established. However, we estimated that a huge volume of airline travellers would be required to be screened in February to April, even under the scenario of significant reduction (90%) in air passengers compared with the same period of previous years. Therefore, ensuring that surveillance and health systems around the world are ready and sufficiently strong to detect and deal with cases seen is a priority.\\nIt is expected that further international exportation of cases from China will occur and cases may appear in any country [30] . Thus, all countries should be prepared for containment, including active surveillance, early detection, isolation and case management, contact tracing and prevention of onward spread of the 2019-nCoV infection [6, 31] . Of additional concern is that the anticipated destinations of hundreds of thousands of travellers departing China are to low-income or lower-middle income countries, where inadequately resourced medical and public health systems might be unable to detect and adequately manage an imported case of 2019n-CoV, including possible subsequent community spread.\\nDue to current limited knowledge of the epidemiology of the virus at the time of writing (e.g. the proportion and infectiousness of asymptomatic or subclinical infections) and the rapidly changing situation of the outbreak, the simplicity of our approach to define importation risk can help to quickly update risk assessments, prioritise surveillance, target limited resources and understand the potential of 2019n-CoV introduction at specific destinations [32] . Compared with other studies [33, 34] , we explored the various scenarios of travel restriction and used a more comprehensive and spatio-temporally detailed population movement matrix, together with details on the actual final destination cities of air passengers based on the global itinerary dataset. These novel datasets provide new insights on the impacts of internal and international connectivity on potential transmission of this emerging pathogen during the LNY holiday and over the next three months.\\nNevertheless, it is important to note that our study has several major limitations. Firstly, while we do present simple scenarios of reduced air travel volumes, our primary analyses assume \"business as usual\" travel based on .

Second, the mobile phone data used may provide an incomplete and biased picture of travellers, as the data only cover the population owning a smart phone and using Baidu apps. Third, the case data used in this study likely varies in quality and completeness due to the timeliness of reporting, varying laboratory diagnosis capacities, and differences in details announced on health authority websites. Fourth, compared with airline travellers leaving Wuhan prior to January 23 rd evacuees from Wuhan during the January 29 th -31 st period might have a higher risk of infection due to their longer stay in Wuhan during the potential continued spread of the virus since January 23 rd . This may result in overestimates of the number of infections in airline travellers from Wuhan prior to the city\\'s lockdown. Based on more recent population movement and epidemiological data, we aim to conduct more sophisticated modelling approaches to assess the effectiveness of control measures in China, the impact of movements of people returning from LNY holiday, as well as the risks of a 2019-nCoV global pandemic.\\n.

       "'The sudden outbreak of the new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) at the end of December 2019 poses a huge threat to human health worldwide. The SARS-CoV-2 virus causes severe respiratory disease that can quickly spread from person to person and in some cases lead to death.\\nResearchers have found that the new SARS-CoV-2 and SARS coronaviruses invade human cells in target tissues in a similar manner via high-affinity binding to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) [1] . In recent epidemiological investigations of the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 and a preliminary study of the clinical characteristics of this disease [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] , researchers have found that patients infected with the new coronavirus have severe symptoms similar to those of the SARS infection. The first batch of clinical data reports of SARS-CoV-2 infection cases in China revealed \"cytokine storms\" in critically ill patients [7, 8] . However, the mechanism of the viral infection and pathological changes in the immune system is still lacking. The sooner this information is added to the current clinical knowledge of these viruses, the better the control and treatment of this disease.\\nHere, we present an automated topic-wise inference method called TWIRLS (Topic-wise inference engine of massive biomedical literatures) for processing the massive biomedical literature to summarize coronavirus host-related entities. TWIRLS is capable of collecting, classifying, and analyzing reported coronavirus studies to reveal these entities based on the distribution of specific genes in the text of the articles. By combining with general protein interaction data, links between certain functional cellular/physiological components can be inferred to fill the knowledge gaps on the probable mechanism of host pathological changes. eventually leads to acute lung injury in the host. Therefore, TWIRLS can be used to guide human researchers by providing further potential therapeutic target information for the treatment of acute viral lung injury based on the regulation of RAS.\\nCoronavirus-study specific entities and host genes As of February 21, 2020, the PubMed database included 14,878 biomedical articles on coronaviruses. We obtained text data (called local samples) from all related articles on the coronavirus that had been peer reviewed and published by human experts, which included the title, abstracts, author and affiliation information (total 3,182,687 words). The goal of the literature mining was to identify host genes and entities that are relevant to coronavirus research and to establish connections between them. An entity can refers to a word or phrase of the concept name (including related concepts, e.g., virus structure and chemical composition, source of infection, and virus type). The gene names were defined using the mammalian official gene symbols in the Hugo Gene Naming Committee (HGNC) database. We directly retrieved 667 candidate genes from the local samples. By establishing a random distribution of one of the candidate genes in a control sample, the significance of this gene appearing in the local samples can be determined when the frequency of the current gene is an outlier of the random distribution of the control samples (see Methods for details). By calculating the odds ratio, we can also further determine the specificity of the association between this gene and the local samples. In this paper, we selected an odds ratio > 6 as the threshold for this judgment, which resulted in 123 coronavirus study-specific host genes (CSHGs).\\nTo determine the specificity of the entity, we made a choice between different texts in the local samples. We removed numbers, symbols, verbs, and garbled characters to obtain clean versions of the local samples. The coronavirus study-specific entities (CSSE) were then identified in only the clean texts containing CSHGs. Based on the clean selected samples, we next built a local dictionary of candidate CSSEs containing 49,293 words after deduplication. Before calculating the random distribution of each entity, we included the synonymous entities into a same entity number (including singular or plural words, active and passive forms, different tenses, suffixes that do not change the meaning, etc.). For example, synonymous entities such as coronaviral, coronavirus, coronaviruses were grouped into one entity as coronavirus and assigned the same number (see entity number in Table S1 , Sheet 1 first column). The previous method of merging synonymous entities was based on a dictionary [9, 10] , which not only relied on the integrity of the dictionary, but also required a long retrieval time. To automatically solve the synonymous entity problem, TWIRLS classifies similar strings based on whether there is a significant statistical association between the character blocks in a set of candidate entities including various synonymous entities (see Methods). After cleaning and processing, CSSEs were identified by TWIRLS using a similar method to that for CSHG as described above.\\nFor the candidate CSSE dictionary, a random distribution model for each entity was built by TWIRLS using the control samples. We identified 623 CSSEs (Table Sl, Sheet 1) based on the outliers discriminated by the random model and calculated odds ratio. For example, TWIRLS found 100 CSSEs close to ACE2, the receptor of SARS and SARS-CoV-2 viruses (see left panel in Figure 1 ). The size of the entity represents the relative distance to ACE2, with a larger size indicating a closer distance to ACE2. Additionally, we present the CSSE cloud of the human receptor gene DPP4 of the MERS virus (see right panel in Figure 1 ).\\nAlthough TWIRLS only identified 623 CSSEs after collation, for human researchers, the information is scattered in words, which is limited for reconstructing understandable mechanistic models. Therefore, TWIRLS clusters CSSEs according to the rules defined by CSHG distribution, as genetic level research can accurately answer and solve physiological and pathological problems.\\nTWIRLS first calculated the specific co-distribution between CSHGs in local samples, then determined the distance between each pair of CSSEs and performs dichotomy clustering according to the linkage relationship between CSSEs and CSHGs. This classified the 623 entities into 32 categories represented as C0-C31 (see category number in Table S1 , Sheet 1 second column). In addition, for each category, TWIRLS also cited the top ten most relevant references for human researchers (Table S2) . Therefore, in any category, according to the CSSE and the most relevant literature, we can quickly provide \"Labels of conclusion-drawn-by-human-researcher\" (HR Labels) for this category. This label outlines the most relevant research directions of the current entity category. For example, for category C3, the HR label is \"Neurotrophic Coronavirus Related to Immune-Mediated Demyelination\". We have summarized the HR labels for the 32 entity categories in Table 1 .\\nThe relative position of any CSHG to a certain CSSE can be estimated by TWIRLS (see Table S1 , the ranking matrix in Sheet 1). As each category contains different entities, we can determine whether a certain CSHG is significantly closer to each entity in the current category based on the ranking matrix between CSHG and CSSE. For example, the average distance between ACE2 and the 92 entities in category C5 is first calculated, then a random distribution model of the average distance between ACE2 and any of the 92 entities (3000-5000 times) is built, and finally, we determine if the average distance between ACE2 and entities in category C5 is significantly less than and deviates from the mean of the random distribution (Z score = -5.8416). The significance of each category associated with each CSHG is then scored by TWIRLS ranging between -10 and +10, with a smaller score indicating the current CSHG is more relevant to the current category (see the Z-score matrix in Table S1 , sheet 2). For an entity category, the associated CSHGs (e.g., Ci CSHGs, where i represents the category number) can thus be selected by a Z score <-3 (the Z scores describing the association between CSHG and any category is summarized in Sheet2 of Table S1 , and the category labels of all CSHGs are provided in Sheet 3).\\nSpecifically, Spike proteins (S proteins) of different coronaviruses recognize different receptor molecules on human cells, such as ACE2 (binds to Spike proteins in SARS and SARS-CoV-2 virus) and DPP4 (binds to Spike protein in MERS virus). We found that these two genes are assigned to the C5 category, which has a corresponding HR label of \"Spike protein (S) of coronavirus\", suggesting that TWIRLS can automatically provide an interface to summarize human findings and help human experts quickly understand the research directions and necessary knowledge in this field.\\nThe distribution and meaning of the data can be compared to specific expression values of CSHG under different conditions (here, the category is used as a condition).

On the other hand, TWIRLS can also recommend the most likely and least likely categories for each signaling pathway. As an example, Table 3 shows the signaling pathways most likely associated with category C3 with the most unlikely corresponding category.\\nWe coupled the data with gene interaction/regulation databases and constructed a generalized protein-protein interaction network (PPI network) among 119 genes out of the 123 CSHGs. We defined the direct interaction between two genes as a 1 degree (1 o ) interaction, and the indirect interaction connecting two genes through a gene as a 2 degree (2 o ) interaction. All the genes in the 1 o networks mined in the PPI database are shown in Figure 2 . The results after deduplication showed 2,004 pairs in the 119 CSHGs (see Table S1 , Sheet 4). As a control, the average interactions of 119 randomly selected genes in the database showed between 252 to 612 pairs (average 220.16, standard deviation 35.15). Compared to random genes, the regulatory connections between CSHGs were significantly enriched (Z score = 50.97).\\nThose CSHGs associated with a certain category had much closer interactions. For example, CSHGs associated with category C3 (or associated with C5 or C10) were closer to each other in the 1 o networks (Figure 2 ), suggesting that TWIRLS can possibly highlight important research directions and biology systems involved in coronavirus-specific research and can provide reliable interfaces for further automatic inference.\\nSeveral hub genes among the 119 CSHGs were further recommended by TWIRLS. Compared to a random sampling from all interactions recorded in the database, these hub genes had significantly increased numbers of interactions with the other 118 CSHGs. The recommended results showed that the three members of the IFITMs family (IFITM1-3) ranked first, second, and sixth among the top ten hub genes (CSSE cloud of the IFITMs family genes is shown in Figure 3 ; detailed ranking recommendation results are shown in Table S1 , Sheet 5). These IFITMs genes showed 115 interactions, accounting for 8.59% out of all 1,338 interactions of the 119 CSHGs. These IFITMs were significantly enriched in the local samples representing updated coronavirus-related All rights reserved.

The IFITMs family plays crucial roles in the induction of interferons during viral infections. Under the action of interferon, IFITMs disrupts intracellular cholesterol homeostasis and prevents the virus from entering the host cell [11] . However, TWIRLS did not directly associate IFITMs with any category, so we needed to provide more information so that TWIRLS can determine which part of these genes might be involved in the coronavirus infection and host body response.\\nCombining with generalized interaction databases provides richer interactions and regulatory linkages. We extended the 119 CSHGs to their 2 o networks based on the interactions with higher likelihood of connections (Combined score> 800). The 2 o networks expanded the number of genes from 119 host genes to 3,494 genes that may be associated with coronavirus (see Table S1 , Sheet 6 with DPP4 [12] . The different distribution of these receptors in the respiratory tract results in different degrees of infection. Although the infection ability of MERS is lower than in SARS, the mortality is higher (in about one-third of patients) because of the deeper infection site [13] . Similar to the SARS virus, viral genomics and structural biology studies have shown that ACE2 is also a functional receptor for the new SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus. After binding to ACE2 via its Spike protein, SARS-CoV-2 undergoes membrane fusion and enters the host cells by endocytosis. The ACE2 peptidase is a key regulator of the Renin-Angiotensin System (RAS). It is highly expressed in the heart, kidney, and testis, and is also expressed at lower levels in other tissues (mainly in the intestine and lungs) [14, 15] . Recent studies have shown that the binding of the S protein to ACE2 in the new coronavirus is 10 to 20 times stronger than in the SARS virus [16] , which may help the new coronavirus infect the host through the upper respiratory tract, significantly increasing its infectivity. Using TWIRLS, we were able to identify both ACE2 and DPP4 genes as CSHGs, and both were significantly associated with the C5 category. The HR label for this category is \"associated with S protein.\"\\nIn addition to ACE2 and DPP4, other CSHGs that are significantly associated with the C5 category include FURIN and TMPRSS2. The former may be required for the H7N1 and H5N1 influenza virus infections, probably via hemagglutinin-induced lysis, whereas the latter is widely reported to mediate and assist in the invasion of host cells by multiple viruses. Transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) is a serine protease that hydrolyzes and activates the spike glycoproteins of human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E), human coronavirus EMC (HCoV-EMC), Sendai virus (SeV) and human interstitial pneumovirus (HMPV), and 1,2,3 fusion glycoproteins of F0, 4a, and 4b human parainfluenza viruses (HPIV) [17, 18] . The function of this gene is essential for the transmission and pathogenesis of influenza A viruses (H1N1, H3N2 and H7N9 strains). It is also involved in the hydrolysis and activation of hemagglutinin proteins, which are essential for viral infectivity [19, 20] . Although entities in the C5 category and in the cited literature mainly show that virus invasion is facilitated by virus-binding receptors and membrane proteases, the biological mechanism of the receptor binding to viruses leading to pathological changes has been reported less frequently.

These inferences are based on a process that finds new genes connected to different categories. The connected categories suggested potential regulatory relationships between different biological functions or phenotypes. The genes that serve as linkers are potential targets for gain-and loss-of-function experiments to identify those systems described by the meaningful entities in these categories.\\nIn this paper, TWIRLS found the 2 o networks showed connections with certain CSHGs associated with categories or with no category. For example, TWIRLS found that CSHGs in the 2 o connections of IFITM1 were mainly concentrated in the C3 category (see Figure 4 ). Interestingly, CSHGs in the 2 o connections of ACE2 and DPP4 associated with C5 category were also enriched in C3 category, inferring that the information summarized in C3 category probably describe the underlying mechanisms of the pathological changes after coronavirus infection. In our analysis, the signaling pathways in C3 were mainly RAS, Vitamin D and RXR activation, and Chemokine signaling, with RAS being the most significant (as shown in Table 3 , which summarizes C3-related signaling pathways). which then linked to C3-associated cytokines including CCL5, CXCL1, CXCL10, CXCL11, CXCL2, CXCL9, CXCR2, and CXCR3 ( Figure 5 ). Subsequently, these linker genes may contain information on the biological mechanisms that may be important for understanding the disease.\\nFor example, TWIRLS recommended angiotensinogen (AGT) and angiotensin II receptor type 2 (AGTR2 or AT2R) genes in the C3 category associated with ACE2. This supports that RAS is probably involved in the pathological changes caused by cytokine storms after S protein binds to ACE2, as suggested by other reports.\\nWe next used TWIRLS to calculate the 1 o and 2 o networks of all 119 CSHGs. Based on the significantly enriched categories of CSHGs in the above networks, TWIRLS separately constructed models for the complex relationships of each CSHG. We found that 45.53% of the All rights reserved.

This suggests that the biological mechanisms described by the C3 and C10 categories might be universally involved. Research on the entities, genes, pathways, and linker genes participating in the C3 and C10 categories could lead to new directions for the prevention, treatment, and clinical management of coronavirus infections.\\nIn this study, we used TWIRLS, a machine-based approach to collect, summarize, and analyze about 15,000 biomedical articles related to coronavirus, with the aim to elucidate the mechanisms underlying coronavirus-induced host pathological changes. Using TWIRLS, we found a possible mechanism involving ACE2/AT2R-RAS-Cytokine signaling, which becomes imbalanced under virus infection leading to cytokine storms. The TWIRLS system is an automated process that can summarize the entities and genes specifically related to coronaviruses. By combining this system with generalized interaction databases, we can reveal further associations that can provide a deeper understanding of the biological mechanisms of the disease phenotype caused by virus-host interactions.\\nvirus to ACE2 may disrupt this balance, which causes a steady-state imbalance of RAS, leading to subsequent pathological changes.\\nAlthough Ang II was originally described as an effective vasoconstrictor, there is growing evidence that it is closely involved in the inflammatory response of the immune system.\\nPro-inflammatory cytokines derived from immune cells normally regulate the RAS component, which further accelerates the formation of systemic and local Ang II [28] [29] [30] . In particular, pro-inflammatory cytokines regulate the production of AGT in the liver and kidney [31] [32] [33] . On the other hand, RAS has also been implicated in mediating the cytokine storm and has functional relationships with the immune system. Angiotensin II regulates vascular tension and stimulates the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines [34, 35] . The production and release of CXC chemokines can induce the accumulation of neutrophils in vivo [36] . Meanwhile, ACE inhibitors and Ang II receptor blockers have been used in a number of cytokine-mediated inflammatory pathologies, and AT1R blockers (angiotensin receptor blocker) were shown to have beneficial effects that were commonly attributed to AT2R activation [37] . At the same time, it was reported that Ang II-stimulated human endothelial cells had increased release of a CXC chemokine, IP-10. The IFN-γ-inducible protein 10 (IP-10 or CXCL10) is mainly expressed in the lung and is a chemoattractant for activated T cells. The expression of IP-10 has been observed in many Th1-type inflammatory diseases, where it is thought to play an important role in recruiting activated T cells to sites of tissue inflammation. Therefore, RAS dysfunction may result in the accumulation of cytokines, such as in the lungs leading to excessive accumulation of immune cells and interstitial fluid, blocking the airways and causing eventual death. As reported in the first severely infected patients diagnosed with COVID-19, a large number of patients experienced \"cytokine storms\" that was fatal [7] . Figure 6 summarizes the functional changes and pathological consequences of RAS system after ACE2 combines with the coronavirus.\\nWe expect the mechanism summarized and reasoned by TWIRLS can be further supported by pathological evidence. To date, only one report of a post-mortem biopsy has been published with pathological data. Although histological examination showed bilateral diffuse alveolar damage with cellular fibromyxoid exudates, the right lung showed evidence of desquamation of All rights reserved.

The schematic representation of the overall study design is shown in Figure 1 and can be summarized in the following steps.\\nThe dataset used in this pipeline were from PubMed articles. First, PubMed was searched for articles including titles, abstracts, author and affiliation information containing the subject keyword \"coronavirus\". The search results were downloaded in txt format for compiling into structured information. The text in the subject abstract set was organized and cleaned, and then assigned to specific corpuses related to coronavirus (specific corpus) and compiled into the subject dictionary. To enhance the accuracy of the effective entities associated with the keyword, we used a random corpus for comparisons. We searched for article abstracts containing the keyword \"public health\" and compiled the abstract set into a random corpus, and then compiled them into a randomized control dictionary, which contains a wide range of proteins, genes, and related biological entities. We also considered a balanced amount of information by setting relevant parameters to adjust the amount of text before carrying out the statistical analyses.\\nBiological entity identification is a key step in the literature mining process [7, 8] . To ensure functionality of the extracted entity, we first compared the entity from the subject dictionary with the human official gene symbols in the Hugo Gene Nomenclature Commission (HGNC) database [9] to generate subject candidate genes using standard nomenclature. In addition, the entities in the abstract were capitalized to avoid errors in the identification process. To obtain widely used gene entities that are precisely related to the subject and to determine the significance of the gene distribution in the specific texts, we calculated the difference in the distribution proportions. We searched for the subject candidate genes in the subject dictionary and the randomized control dictionary, respectively. We also counted the number of abstracts containing each subject candidate gene in each abstract set, respectively. Finally, we calculated the odds ratio of each subject candidate gene and sorted them into a list of precisely related genes (CSHG).\\nSimilar to the process of identifying CSHG, we calculated whether entities were significantly distributed in a specific corpus. We counted the number of texts containing each CSHG in a specific corpus, and then counted the number of each candidate entity in the corpus subset. Next, we randomly selected the same amount of text from the random control corpus and then counted the number of each candidate entity in this subset of the random corpus. This was repeated 100-10000 times in the random corpus to generate candidate entities in the specified amount of text of the random distribution model. According to the central limit theorem (CLT), the distribution of random sampling averages of randomly distributed data always conforms to a normal distribution. Therefore, we can use the Z score to evaluate whether an entity is significant in a specific text.

       "'The sudden outbreak of the new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) at the end of December 2019 poses a huge threat to human health worldwide. The SARS-CoV-2 virus causes severe respiratory disease that can quickly spread from person to person and in some cases lead to death. Researchers have found that the new SARS-CoV-2 and SARS coronaviruses invade human cells in target tissues in a similar manner via high-affinity binding to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) [1] . In recent epidemiological investigations of the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 and a preliminary study of the clinical characteristics of this disease [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] , researchers have found that patients infected with the new coronavirus have severe symptoms similar to those of the SARS infection. The first batch of clinical data reports of SARS-CoV-2 infection cases in China revealed \"cytokine storms\" in critically ill patients [7, 8] . However, the mechanism of the viral infection and pathological changes in the immune system is still lacking. The sooner this information is added to the current clinical knowledge of these viruses, the better the control and treatment of this disease. Here, we present an automated topic-wise inference method called TWIRLS (Topic-wise inference engine of massive biomedical literatures) for processing the massive biomedical literature to summarize coronavirus host-related entities. TWIRLS is capable of collecting, classifying, and analyzing reported coronavirus studies to reveal these entities based on the distribution of specific genes in the text of the articles. By combining with general protein interaction data, links between certain functional cellular/physiological components can be inferred to fill the knowledge gaps on the probable mechanism of host pathological changes. eventually leads to acute lung injury in the host. Therefore, TWIRLS can be used to guide human researchers by providing further potential therapeutic target information for the treatment of acute viral lung injury based on the regulation of RAS. Coronavirus-study specific entities and host genes As of February 21, 2020, the PubMed database included 14,878 biomedical articles on coronaviruses. We obtained text data (called local samples) from all related articles on the coronavirus that had been peer reviewed and published by human experts, which included the title, abstracts, author and affiliation information (total 3,182,687 words). The goal of the literature mining was to identify host genes and entities that are relevant to coronavirus research and to establish connections between them. An entity can refers to a word or phrase of the concept name (including related concepts, e.g., virus structure and chemical composition, source of infection, and virus type). The gene names were defined using the mammalian official gene symbols in the Hugo Gene Naming Committee (HGNC) database. We directly retrieved 667 candidate genes from the local samples. By establishing a random distribution of one of the candidate genes in a control sample, the significance of this gene appearing in the local samples can be determined when the frequency of the current gene is an outlier of the random distribution of the control samples (see Methods for details). By calculating the odds ratio, we can also further determine the specificity of the association between this gene and the local samples. In this paper, we selected an odds ratio > 6 as the threshold for this judgment, which resulted in 123 coronavirus study-specific host genes (CSHGs). To determine the specificity of the entity, we made a choice between different texts in the local samples. We removed numbers, symbols, verbs, and garbled characters to obtain clean versions of the local samples. The coronavirus study-specific entities (CSSE) were then identified in only the clean texts containing CSHGs. Based on the clean selected samples, we next built a local dictionary of candidate CSSEs containing 49,293 words after deduplication. Before calculating the random distribution of each entity, we included the synonymous entities into a same entity number (including singular or plural words, active and passive forms, different tenses, suffixes that do not change the meaning, etc.). For example, synonymous entities such as coronaviral, coronavirus, coronaviruses were grouped into one entity as coronavirus and assigned the same number (see entity number in Table S1 , Sheet 1 first column). The previous method of merging synonymous entities was based on a dictionary [9, 10] , which not only relied on the integrity of the dictionary, but also required a long retrieval time. To automatically solve the synonymous entity problem, TWIRLS classifies similar strings based on whether there is a significant statistical association between the character blocks in a set of candidate entities including various synonymous entities (see Methods). After cleaning and processing, CSSEs were identified by TWIRLS using a similar method to that for CSHG as described above. For the candidate CSSE dictionary, a random distribution model for each entity was built by TWIRLS using the control samples. We identified 623 CSSEs (Table Sl, Sheet 1) based on the outliers discriminated by the random model and calculated odds ratio. For example, TWIRLS found 100 CSSEs close to ACE2, the receptor of SARS and SARS-CoV-2 viruses (see left panel in Figure 1 ). The size of the entity represents the relative distance to ACE2, with a larger size indicating a closer distance to ACE2. Additionally, we present the CSSE cloud of the human receptor gene DPP4 of the MERS virus (see right panel in Figure 1 ). Although TWIRLS only identified 623 CSSEs after collation, for human researchers, the information is scattered in words, which is limited for reconstructing understandable mechanistic models. Therefore, TWIRLS clusters CSSEs according to the rules defined by CSHG distribution, as genetic level research can accurately answer and solve physiological and pathological problems. TWIRLS first calculated the specific co-distribution between CSHGs in local samples, then determined the distance between each pair of CSSEs and performs dichotomy clustering according to the linkage relationship between CSSEs and CSHGs. This classified the 623 entities into 32 categories represented as C0-C31 (see category number in Table S1 , Sheet 1 second column). In addition, for each category, TWIRLS also cited the top ten most relevant references for human researchers (Table S2) . Therefore, in any category, according to the CSSE and the most relevant literature, we can quickly provide \"Labels of conclusion-drawn-by-human-researcher\" (HR Labels) for this category. This label outlines the most relevant research directions of the current entity category. For example, for category C3, the HR label is \"Neurotrophic Coronavirus Related to Immune-Mediated Demyelination\". We have summarized the HR labels for the 32 entity categories in Table 1 . The relative position of any CSHG to a certain CSSE can be estimated by TWIRLS (see Table S1 , the ranking matrix in Sheet 1). As each category contains different entities, we can determine whether a certain CSHG is significantly closer to each entity in the current category based on the ranking matrix between CSHG and CSSE. For example, the average distance between ACE2 and the 92 entities in category C5 is first calculated, then a random distribution model of the average distance between ACE2 and any of the 92 entities (3000-5000 times) is built, and finally, we determine if the average distance between ACE2 and entities in category C5 is significantly less than and deviates from the mean of the random distribution (Z score = -5.8416). The significance of each category associated with each CSHG is then scored by TWIRLS ranging between -10 and +10, with a smaller score indicating the current CSHG is more relevant to the current category (see the Z-score matrix in Table S1 , sheet 2). For an entity category, the associated CSHGs (e.g., Ci CSHGs, where i represents the category number) can thus be selected by a Z score <-3 (the Z scores describing the association between CSHG and any category is summarized in Sheet2 of Table S1 , and the category labels of all CSHGs are provided in Sheet 3). Specifically, Spike proteins (S proteins) of different coronaviruses recognize different receptor molecules on human cells, such as ACE2 (binds to Spike proteins in SARS and SARS-CoV-2 virus) and DPP4 (binds to Spike protein in MERS virus). We found that these two genes are assigned to the C5 category, which has a corresponding HR label of \"Spike protein (S) of coronavirus\", suggesting that TWIRLS can automatically provide an interface to summarize human findings and help human experts quickly understand the research directions and necessary knowledge in this field. The distribution and meaning of the data can be compared to specific expression values of CSHG under different conditions (here, the category is used as a condition).

On the other hand, TWIRLS can also recommend the most likely and least likely categories for each signaling pathway. As an example, Table 3 shows the signaling pathways most likely associated with category C3 with the most unlikely corresponding category. We coupled the data with gene interaction/regulation databases and constructed a generalized protein-protein interaction network (PPI network) among 119 genes out of the 123 CSHGs. We defined the direct interaction between two genes as a 1 degree (1 o ) interaction, and the indirect interaction connecting two genes through a gene as a 2 degree (2 o ) interaction. All the genes in the 1 o networks mined in the PPI database are shown in Figure 2 . The results after deduplication showed 2,004 pairs in the 119 CSHGs (see Table S1 , Sheet 4). As a control, the average interactions of 119 randomly selected genes in the database showed between 252 to 612 pairs (average 220.16, standard deviation 35.15). Compared to random genes, the regulatory connections between CSHGs were significantly enriched (Z score = 50.97). Those CSHGs associated with a certain category had much closer interactions. For example, CSHGs associated with category C3 (or associated with C5 or C10) were closer to each other in the 1 o networks (Figure 2 ), suggesting that TWIRLS can possibly highlight important research directions and biology systems involved in coronavirus-specific research and can provide reliable interfaces for further automatic inference. Several hub genes among the 119 CSHGs were further recommended by TWIRLS. Compared to a random sampling from all interactions recorded in the database, these hub genes had significantly increased numbers of interactions with the other 118 CSHGs. The recommended results showed that the three members of the IFITMs family (IFITM1-3) ranked first, second, and sixth among the top ten hub genes (CSSE cloud of the IFITMs family genes is shown in Figure 3 ; detailed ranking recommendation results are shown in Table S1 , Sheet 5). These IFITMs genes showed 115 interactions, accounting for 8.59% out of all 1,338 interactions of the 119 CSHGs. These IFITMs were significantly enriched in the local samples representing updated coronavirus-related All rights reserved.

The IFITMs family plays crucial roles in the induction of interferons during viral infections. Under the action of interferon, IFITMs disrupts intracellular cholesterol homeostasis and prevents the virus from entering the host cell [11] . However, TWIRLS did not directly associate IFITMs with any category, so we needed to provide more information so that TWIRLS can determine which part of these genes might be involved in the coronavirus infection and host body response. Combining with generalized interaction databases provides richer interactions and regulatory linkages. We extended the 119 CSHGs to their 2 o networks based on the interactions with higher likelihood of connections (Combined score> 800). The 2 o networks expanded the number of genes from 119 host genes to 3,494 genes that may be associated with coronavirus (see Table S1 , Sheet 6 with DPP4 [12] . The different distribution of these receptors in the respiratory tract results in different degrees of infection. Although the infection ability of MERS is lower than in SARS, the mortality is higher (in about one-third of patients) because of the deeper infection site [13] . Similar to the SARS virus, viral genomics and structural biology studies have shown that ACE2 is also a functional receptor for the new SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus. After binding to ACE2 via its Spike protein, SARS-CoV-2 undergoes membrane fusion and enters the host cells by endocytosis. The ACE2 peptidase is a key regulator of the Renin-Angiotensin System (RAS). It is highly expressed in the heart, kidney, and testis, and is also expressed at lower levels in other tissues (mainly in the intestine and lungs) [14, 15] . Recent studies have shown that the binding of the S protein to ACE2 in the new coronavirus is 10 to 20 times stronger than in the SARS virus [16] , which may help the new coronavirus infect the host through the upper respiratory tract, significantly increasing its infectivity. Using TWIRLS, we were able to identify both ACE2 and DPP4 genes as CSHGs, and both were significantly associated with the C5 category. The HR label for this category is \"associated with S protein.\" In addition to ACE2 and DPP4, other CSHGs that are significantly associated with the C5 category include FURIN and TMPRSS2. The former may be required for the H7N1 and H5N1 influenza virus infections, probably via hemagglutinin-induced lysis, whereas the latter is widely reported to mediate and assist in the invasion of host cells by multiple viruses. Transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) is a serine protease that hydrolyzes and activates the spike glycoproteins of human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E), human coronavirus EMC (HCoV-EMC), Sendai virus (SeV) and human interstitial pneumovirus (HMPV), and 1,2,3 fusion glycoproteins of F0, 4a, and 4b human parainfluenza viruses (HPIV) [17, 18] . The function of this gene is essential for the transmission and pathogenesis of influenza A viruses (H1N1, H3N2 and H7N9 strains). It is also involved in the hydrolysis and activation of hemagglutinin proteins, which are essential for viral infectivity [19, 20] . Although entities in the C5 category and in the cited literature mainly show that virus invasion is facilitated by virus-binding receptors and membrane proteases, the biological mechanism of the receptor binding to viruses leading to pathological changes has been reported less frequently.

These inferences are based on a process that finds new genes connected to different categories. The connected categories suggested potential regulatory relationships between different biological functions or phenotypes. The genes that serve as linkers are potential targets for gain-and loss-of-function experiments to identify those systems described by the meaningful entities in these categories. In this paper, TWIRLS found the 2 o networks showed connections with certain CSHGs associated with categories or with no category. For example, TWIRLS found that CSHGs in the 2 o connections of IFITM1 were mainly concentrated in the C3 category (see Figure 4 ). Interestingly, CSHGs in the 2 o connections of ACE2 and DPP4 associated with C5 category were also enriched in C3 category, inferring that the information summarized in C3 category probably describe the underlying mechanisms of the pathological changes after coronavirus infection. In our analysis, the signaling pathways in C3 were mainly RAS, Vitamin D and RXR activation, and Chemokine signaling, with RAS being the most significant (as shown in Table 3 , which summarizes C3-related signaling pathways). which then linked to C3-associated cytokines including CCL5, CXCL1, CXCL10, CXCL11, CXCL2, CXCL9, CXCR2, and CXCR3 ( Figure 5 ). Subsequently, these linker genes may contain information on the biological mechanisms that may be important for understanding the disease. For example, TWIRLS recommended angiotensinogen (AGT) and angiotensin II receptor type 2 (AGTR2 or AT2R) genes in the C3 category associated with ACE2. This supports that RAS is probably involved in the pathological changes caused by cytokine storms after S protein binds to ACE2, as suggested by other reports. We next used TWIRLS to calculate the 1 o and 2 o networks of all 119 CSHGs. Based on the significantly enriched categories of CSHGs in the above networks, TWIRLS separately constructed models for the complex relationships of each CSHG. We found that 45.53% of the All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission. the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

This suggests that the biological mechanisms described by the C3 and C10 categories might be universally involved. Research on the entities, genes, pathways, and linker genes participating in the C3 and C10 categories could lead to new directions for the prevention, treatment, and clinical management of coronavirus infections. In this study, we used TWIRLS, a machine-based approach to collect, summarize, and analyze about 15,000 biomedical articles related to coronavirus, with the aim to elucidate the mechanisms underlying coronavirus-induced host pathological changes. Using TWIRLS, we found a possible mechanism involving ACE2/AT2R-RAS-Cytokine signaling, which becomes imbalanced under virus infection leading to cytokine storms. The TWIRLS system is an automated process that can summarize the entities and genes specifically related to coronaviruses. By combining this system with generalized interaction databases, we can reveal further associations that can provide a deeper understanding of the biological mechanisms of the disease phenotype caused by virus-host interactions. virus to ACE2 may disrupt this balance, which causes a steady-state imbalance of RAS, leading to subsequent pathological changes. Although Ang II was originally described as an effective vasoconstrictor, there is growing evidence that it is closely involved in the inflammatory response of the immune system. Pro-inflammatory cytokines derived from immune cells normally regulate the RAS component, which further accelerates the formation of systemic and local Ang II [28] [29] [30] . In particular, pro-inflammatory cytokines regulate the production of AGT in the liver and kidney [31] [32] [33] . On the other hand, RAS has also been implicated in mediating the cytokine storm and has functional relationships with the immune system. Angiotensin II regulates vascular tension and stimulates the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines [34, 35] . The production and release of CXC chemokines can induce the accumulation of neutrophils in vivo [36] . Meanwhile, ACE inhibitors and Ang II receptor blockers have been used in a number of cytokine-mediated inflammatory pathologies, and AT1R blockers (angiotensin receptor blocker) were shown to have beneficial effects that were commonly attributed to AT2R activation [37] . At the same time, it was reported that Ang II-stimulated human endothelial cells had increased release of a CXC chemokine, IP-10. The IFN-γ-inducible protein 10 (IP-10 or CXCL10) is mainly expressed in the lung and is a chemoattractant for activated T cells. The expression of IP-10 has been observed in many Th1-type inflammatory diseases, where it is thought to play an important role in recruiting activated T cells to sites of tissue inflammation. Therefore, RAS dysfunction may result in the accumulation of cytokines, such as in the lungs leading to excessive accumulation of immune cells and interstitial fluid, blocking the airways and causing eventual death. As reported in the first severely infected patients diagnosed with COVID-19, a large number of patients experienced \"cytokine storms\" that was fatal [7] . Figure 6 summarizes the functional changes and pathological consequences of RAS system after ACE2 combines with the coronavirus. We expect the mechanism summarized and reasoned by TWIRLS can be further supported by pathological evidence. To date, only one report of a post-mortem biopsy has been published with pathological data. Although histological examination showed bilateral diffuse alveolar damage with cellular fibromyxoid exudates, the right lung showed evidence of desquamation of All rights reserved.

The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is . https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.02.24.20025437 doi: medRxiv preprint We used PubMed, the most widely used database of biological literature, as the resource for the text mining. The schematic representation of the overall study design is shown in Figure 1 and can be summarized in the following steps. The dataset used in this pipeline were from PubMed articles. First, PubMed was searched for articles including titles, abstracts, author and affiliation information containing the subject keyword \"coronavirus\". The search results were downloaded in txt format for compiling into structured information. The text in the subject abstract set was organized and cleaned, and then assigned to specific corpuses related to coronavirus (specific corpus) and compiled into the subject dictionary. To enhance the accuracy of the effective entities associated with the keyword, we used a random corpus for comparisons. We searched for article abstracts containing the keyword \"public health\" and compiled the abstract set into a random corpus, and then compiled them into a randomized control dictionary, which contains a wide range of proteins, genes, and related biological entities. We also considered a balanced amount of information by setting relevant parameters to adjust the amount of text before carrying out the statistical analyses. Biological entity identification is a key step in the literature mining process [7, 8] . To ensure functionality of the extracted entity, we first compared the entity from the subject dictionary with the human official gene symbols in the Hugo Gene Nomenclature Commission (HGNC) database [9] to generate subject candidate genes using standard nomenclature. In addition, the entities in the abstract were capitalized to avoid errors in the identification process. To obtain widely used gene entities that are precisely related to the subject and to determine the significance of the gene distribution in the specific texts, we calculated the difference in the distribution proportions. We searched for the subject candidate genes in the subject dictionary and the randomized control dictionary, respectively. We also counted the number of abstracts containing each subject candidate gene in each abstract set, respectively. Finally, we calculated the odds ratio of each subject candidate gene and sorted them into a list of precisely related genes (CSHG). Similar to the process of identifying CSHG, we calculated whether entities were significantly distributed in a specific corpus. We counted the number of texts containing each CSHG in a specific corpus, and then counted the number of each candidate entity in the corpus subset. Next, we randomly selected the same amount of text from the random control corpus and then counted the number of each candidate entity in this subset of the random corpus. This was repeated 100-10000 times in the random corpus to generate candidate entities in the specified amount of text of the random distribution model. According to the central limit theorem (CLT), the distribution of random sampling averages of randomly distributed data always conforms to a normal distribution. Therefore, we can use the Z score to evaluate whether an entity is significant in a specific text. Here, we used a Z score cutoff value > 6. In addition, some entities have singular and plural noun forms, and synonyms with multiple forms in the abstracts. Therefore, we numbered the subject-related entity and automatically combined nouns with plural forms and homologous words with adjectives and adverb roots into the same entity, and then assigned them the same number.
